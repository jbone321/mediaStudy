And made me feel I could not be authentic.  Some people are the way they are and there is nothing we can do to make them shine and be happy.  So, focus on ourselfes is the best way to roll.  Stop chasing and let them chase u.  Is time to be selfish and take care of us before others that dont even appreciate u taking the time to check on them or worry about.",

Every tip you covered can be a journal prompt to start revamping these areas in our lives to reflect more ease, authenticity, and peace. \u2764",
