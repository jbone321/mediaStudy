I went to a therapist 30+ years ago after a failed relationship devastated me which seems incredible to me now. But my therapist, Molly, told me that I needed to learn to love myself. She suggested I get a dog to do it, and I told her the dog wasn't necessary, that I could do that. And thankfully I have. I've thought of writing this  on the wall in my bedroom--Imagine a woman in love with herself...\ud83d\ude0a\u2764",

Social media makes you feel lonely even if you're in a relationship.  Travelling solo sucks (unless you use a group like via Gadventures or something, and then hope you get lucky with a good group instead of solo weirdos).  Eating solo sucks.  Cinema alone sucks.  And if we don't have kids, there's less to pay taxes toward your care when you're older.\n\nBut being with someone can suck too.  More money spent each month and the pressure that adds.  Constantly needing to think of date ideas.  You end up missing your alone time...even though during that alone time you hate being alone and want someone else.  Ugh.",
