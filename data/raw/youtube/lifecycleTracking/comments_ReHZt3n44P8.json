Last year we were able to voice chat/text chat with each other until a few weeks ago we were no longer to voice chat/text chat due to minors talking with adults (18+).  So my two questions are:  Since we both are verified via government i.d., can my friend scan my QR Code to become trusted connections? and 2nd question is Does he have to scan my QR Code Live (In Person) or can it be a screenshot of my QR Code? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14",

The oldest one will go to his/her profile and go to their qr code,\nthey will share it to you via screenshot/irl qr code,\n scan the qr code either using \n-roblox qr code scanner\n(roblox -> your profile -> qr code -> top right will be a scanner) (mobile only)\n-camera to scan qr code\n-or screenshot their qr code and put it in a qr code scanner (app)\n\n3. after doing these you should be able to send a trusted connection to the oldest one, the oldest one must accept the sent trusted connection, after acceppting, join a game and test it out if you can see your chat!\n\nHope this helps.",
