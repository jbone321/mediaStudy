Very good use of a tone generator!\n\nOne time had a customer with a similar issue, we had a cable broken in the floor heating circuit run. Just so happens the shop I worked for also did high voltage and substation work too, and we had an 80kV old school Hi-pot tester. We had some continuity but the resistance was very high. We figured we could weld the wires back together with an 80,000v pulse from the test set, and it worked! Then we used a Variac to send some current through the new connection we burnt, and scanned the floor with a hi-res infrared camera. Immediately isolated the break point and homeowner only had to replace one tile. Love it!",
