Putting it on a surface with holes just means lost juices! Sure you 'can' use them in a pan sauce, but that's just adding them to the surface again and they're so much better inside!\n2) I personally prefer a dryer steak, in the Devonshire pub style - first salt the steak and leave to sit for an hour or two.\nThen brush off the salt (enough has absorbed that you don't need it visible on the surface) and pat it very dry with a towel.\nThen straight in a hot pan. No oil, no butter, no basting! Just straight-out steak! (Cooked using the timings mentioned here - a minute on each side going upwards for each level of doneness; so 1min each side for rare, 2min for medium rare, 3min for medium, 4min for medium done, 5min for well done.)\nBecause it's so dry, you get an even better sear, and sometimes even a little bit of a flaky 'char' if the pan is hot enough (even without direct fire). And a perfectly juicy interior too!",
