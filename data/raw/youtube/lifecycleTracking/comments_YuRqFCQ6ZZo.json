Ok im sold, Insym getting stuck in the toilet brought me right back! No water is a weird thing that humans do, I wonder why, it must smell so bad! Insym would be an amazing store owner by how good he is at keeping track of the other workers, he would be a killer owner or boss, truly you have to micromanager so much the high you get on the pole!",
