First, walking away and back is not how you \"trigger\" the event (it can't be triggered, it's just random).\nSecond, you don't have to kill the sheriff, just wait until the scene ends and the sheriff starts walking away. Simply push him, he will pull out his revolver, beat it out of his hand, he will pull out repeater, disarm him the same way, he will finally pull out his bolt action rifle. Beat if out of his hands and immediately pick it up from the ground. Then immediately go to the main menu, open compendium and verify that the rifle has been added to your weapons, then go to Settings->Graphics and run the benchmark test. When it loads, just stop the test, you will return back to the game. You will respawn in Valentine with your new rifle saved to your inventory with no bounty on your head and no honor penalty.",

Anytime I would pull out any of the repeaters instead, I\u2019d be wondering why it\u2019s taking so many shots to end dudes. Then I\u2019d chec and realize the issue, from there it was two shots max needed m, no matter the distance \ud83d\ude05",
