Like you can see it pop out of existence as he goes to \"put it away\" (where it just disappears).\n\nEdit: I realize in games you can't make it 100% good. However, take RDR2 or TLOU2, both games when they put an item, there would still be an animation of said item going into their bag/satchel before disappearing. It wasn't too detailed, but it was there. I would assume from one of the biggest games of all time, they have something like this. However, For this, if you look close enough, the phone just kinda vanishes into his hand when he goes to put it away.",
