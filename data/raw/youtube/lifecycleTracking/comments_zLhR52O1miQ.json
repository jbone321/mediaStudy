You don\u2019t seem to follow rigid steps, you just understand the core of it and simplify things naturally. I\u2019ve been working a long time, and people who think like that often struggle in certain workplaces. Not because they\u2019re not capable, but because they see through complexity quickly and focus on what actually matters. That kind of clarity isn\u2019t always comfortable for others. It\u2019s a strength though. Not everyone can think that way.",
