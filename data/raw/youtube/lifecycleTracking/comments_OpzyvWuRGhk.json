                    "text": "Homemade Apple Pie Steps:\n\nIngredients\nCrust: 2 (9-inch) pie crusts (homemade or store-bought)\nApples: 6\u20138 cups (peeled, cored, and 1/4-inch sliced) \u2013 Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or a mix are recommended\nSugar: 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar\nThickener: 1/4 cup all-purpose flour or cornstarch\nSpices & Flavor: 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 tbsp lemon juice\nFat: 2 tbsp unsalted butter, cubed (for dotting)\nFinish: 1 large egg + 1 tbsp milk (for egg wash), coarse sugar (optional) \nStep-by-Step Instructions\n1. Prepare the Crust\nIf making homemade, combine flour, salt, and chilled butter, then add ice-cold water until the dough just holds together.\nDivide into two disks, wrap in plastic, and chill for at least 1 hour.\nOn a floured surface, roll out one disk to a 12-inch circle and place it in a 9-inch pie plate. \n2. Prepare the Filling\nPeel, core, and slice apples to 1/4-inch thickness.\nIn a large bowl, toss apple slices with lemon juice, sugars, flour (or cornstarch), cinnamon, and nutmeg until well coated.\nTip: Let the mixture sit for 20 minutes to allow the spices to penetrate. \n3. Assemble the Pie\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) or 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) depending on your recipe.\nSpoon the apple filling into the bottom crust, mounding slightly in the center.\nDot the top of the apples with small pieces of butter.\nRoll out the second disk of dough and place it on top of the filling.\nTrim excess dough, seal the edges by pinching or fluting, and cut 4\u20135 slits in the top for steam ventilation.\nBrush the top crust with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. \n4. Bake the Pie\nPlace the pie on a rimmed baking sheet (to catch leaks) on the lower-middle rack.\nBake at 400\u00b0F\u2013425\u00b0F for 15-25 minutes, then reduce oven temp to 350\u00b0F\u2013375\u00b0F for another 40-50 minutes.\nTip: Cover the edges with a pie shield or foil if they brown too quickly.\nThe pie is done when the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbling through the vents. \n5. Cool and Serve\nPlace the pie on a wire rack and let it cool for at least 3 hours. Note: Cutting into a warm pie will result in runny filling\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4",
