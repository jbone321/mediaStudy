I can't think of ONE other content creator, across various genres, who advertises something for free. Maybe Andrew gets paid every time someone clicks the link, but come on, that's probably pocket change when he COULD use that same time slot in every video promoting a sponsored product. It'd take serious convincing for me to believe Andrew ever stopped working for the CIA. Didn't he also disappear from posting new content for a couple months? What happened to his and his wife's plan to leave the US and completely disappear from the internet, including changing their physical appearances?",
