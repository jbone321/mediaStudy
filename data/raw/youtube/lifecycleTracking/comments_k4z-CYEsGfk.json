It\u2019s the same thing \u2014 just a different bracket.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason why The Parkers is making ad executives and company managers millions of dollars today \u2014 today and yesterday \u2014 and Mo\u2019Nique isn\u2019t making one cent from that show because she didn\u2019t know how to negotiate her contract properly at the time.\n\nHonestly, I think actors need to be able to go to court and sue for back residuals, or at least secure residuals moving forward, because this just isn\u2019t right. I\u2019m surprised there hasn\u2019t already been more legal action over unpaid or unfair residual agreements. It feels like there should be a precedent for that.",

There is no reason why companies should be making millions and millions of dollars off rerun TV shows and the actors themselves not making any money from it. In that sense, it\u2019s just the rich getting richer. The actors need to be able to catch up to those rich people as well, just like the lower class needs to be able to catch up to the middle class. It\u2019s the same thing \u2014 just a different bracket.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason why The Parkers is making ad executives and company managers millions of dollars today \u2014 today and yesterday \u2014 and Mo\u2019Nique isn\u2019t making one cent from that show because she didn\u2019t know how to negotiate her contract properly at the time.\n\nHonestly, I think actors need to be able to go to court and sue for back residuals, or at least secure residuals moving forward, because this just isn\u2019t right. I\u2019m surprised there hasn\u2019t already been more legal action over unpaid or unfair residual agreements. It feels like there should be a precedent for that.",
