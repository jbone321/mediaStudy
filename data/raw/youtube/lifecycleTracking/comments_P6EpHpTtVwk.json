It never had the polish of Armada 3 or the size and unit variety of SOGE but was still hours of fun to be found \ud83d\ude0a\n\nImo what BSG is just sitting begging for is a First Cylon War era title far closer to that Sins mod. An actual RTS instead of turn based with much larger scale of battle ground to play over and number and type of units that can be fielded. Deadlock already scratched the turn based itch and did it really well. \n\nOf course there's the other far more glaringly obvious route that I'm honestly surprised hasn't already been done outside game mods, Homeworld. Talk about a perfect fit of genre, style and format.",
