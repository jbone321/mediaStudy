I decided to show all of it to you guys right off the bat, completely unedited and uncut, to let the game do the talking. If you would like to hear my input, that's in the 2nd half of the video. Overall, I think they are on the right path and they have the correct team to make this happen. As a moto gamer, I am extremely excited for this game and can't wait for it's release! Feel free to let me know what you guys think in the comments, the more opinions the better, that is how progress is made. Thanks again to the MTG team (JV this track is unbelievable), keep working hard guys the community see's it and appreciates it!",

I am excited to see the future of this game!",

It looks like will have the tracks and bikes to do that. Also building out my bikes is one of favorite things to do. As a console guy my legends gives you that but there\u2019s still things you can\u2019t change like triple clamp brands, linkage, clutch cover. They have suspension but being able to decide if you want it to be coated, anodized, air or spring etc.. I\u2019m really looking forward to this game.",
