There might also be Pok\u00e9mon Champions what is a Switch and mobile game too so I hope and believe it will be free like Pok\u00e9mon Unite, that game looks very nive it's like a modern version of Pok\u00e9mon Stadium! But about of games that I really hope to see in Pok\u00e9mon Presents theh're just Gen 10 Pok\u00e9mon games for the Switch 2, but i'm not sure about that because Game Freak has been making Beast of Reincarnation what looks amazing new action RPG game that I really hope to see is coming for the Switch 2 too! But is there still some people in Game Freak that could been making Gen 10 Pok\u00e9mon games too? The Switch 2 gives a lot of possibilities for the next gen Pok\u00e9mon games! But if it's too early for them I would love to see Let's Go Johto games or Black & White remakes! February 27: Here we go! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude0a",

Metroid Prime 4 was a Switch game. They haven't made anything Using or performing for the NS2. That doesn't happen for about 2 years. Nintendo Needs to Make Larger Storage for cartridges. I am thinking is Nintendo Made Blank carts of various size maybe people can save their digital Games on a Cartridge.",
