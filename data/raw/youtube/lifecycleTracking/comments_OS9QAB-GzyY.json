                    "text": "My songs might not have lyrics, but they have stories - and if you don't mind me sharing this \"last one\" with you, I'd love to do that!\n\nThe initial draft of this song [back in 2017] used to be called 'Chords', and some people would remember that. But after things got more serious and I finally finished writing this piece, I felt this song needed another name. \n\n'Kawaii' was probably one of the most memorable words my brain kept after my first trip to Japan 9 years ago. It is an easy word to absorb sonically. And another thing I noticed around that trip was - Kawaii was a word often to be associated with kids and babies. I just remember hearing people saying 'kawaii' and laughing or showing their biggest and most genuine smile after speaking that word - and that moved me in a special way. \n\nThis song is probably the most simple of the album - one guitar track, quiet bass, small drums and an electric piano. Almost a lo-fi type of song, with the effect of \"less is more\" activated - which is so rare for a guitar player, including myself. \nI remember while recording the demo and the final version at East West - I wanted it to feel the \"purity\" of this music, even though I still can't explain what that means exactly.\n\nThe idea of Kawaii's Music Video was the easiest to visualize comparing the other ones we did. It was clear enough to me that there was no better message than having kids as the main characters to carry the message of it.\n\nThis song is a reminder to the innocence - a call to genuine joy, and the search for a pure life's perspective. \nThe shortcut to God's happiness.\n\nThank you for watching! \n\nPs.: \"ASATO' is around the corner! Can't believe!!!\n\nKindest regards,\nMA.",
