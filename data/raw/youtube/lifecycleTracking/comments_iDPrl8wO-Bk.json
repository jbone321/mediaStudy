Huggy is back, Lily is a lot like mommy, the monster plushies are similar to the smiling critters and catnap, and the root monster(if it actually ends up being an antagonist) is very similar to doughy. It\u2019s like chapter 5 is circling back to pay homage to each of the previous chapters before the final confrontation with the prototype. If that really ends up being the case. Then bravo Mob entertainment. BRAVO!",
