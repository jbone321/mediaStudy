Its not confirmed but the VA to me just feels queasy like its one of those AI voice models. The 3d models all look like stock unity assets, especially the monsters from generic robot and turret to generic humanoid.\n\nIf you want a GOOD fps co-op roguelike play Mycopunk, its much better and feels much cleaner. but if you gotta buy this really watch your time and ask yourself before you hit two hours \"Was that fun?\" so you can inevitably refund it.",
