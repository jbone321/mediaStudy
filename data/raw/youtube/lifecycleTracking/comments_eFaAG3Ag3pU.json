They took a urine test and according to them the results came back \"normal\" and I was told to just sit down when I pee. I see that's one of your first options too but added more options and deeper explanations to possible other reasons why this dripping is happening. I usually just stay in the bathroom longer and make sure the pee all comes out. I should work on relaxing my pelvic floor too.  Thanks for the video doctor",
