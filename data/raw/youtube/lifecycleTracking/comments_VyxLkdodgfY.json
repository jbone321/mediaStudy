It's pretty \"normal\" to exaggerate when we talk to ourselves, I think. I often find myself thinking \"I'm so ugly! Just hideous!\" When in reality, it's more like \"I'm not looking my best today\". Or \"I'm such an idiot!\" When I should say \"that was not a smart decision for someone who is usually fairly intelligent\"\nKnowing that my brain will actually believe the hyperbole gives me pause--and hopefully I will be more mindful of how  I talk to myself!!",

(Which is weird all on its own, but....) \n\nLife is a lot better since I learned to recognize when I'm doing it again and let it go.  \n\nStill seems to be a common practice in the world around me, though.  Thanks so much for the name -- just that is going to be a great help recovering from it, and the term will be polished to a fine sheen before I'm through using it... \ud83e\udd74",

Look, I appreciate your content but as a well informed realist that has suffered way too much already, Im tired of lowering the bar to make myself feel better. I'm not able to trick myself like that.
