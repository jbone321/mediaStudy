I'm thinking about it and needing help.  What is the difference and the significance of the difference between \"OF\" and \"BY\"?  Because I know there is a difference and a reason the translation is \"OF\" as opposed to \"BY\" and so I need a little help if someone can.  Thanks in advance and love y'all to life!!!  XOXOXO",
