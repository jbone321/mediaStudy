I use two temp switches like you have, I have one with the probe stuck into the fins plugged in the power and another temp switch with the actual room temp plugged into the fin switch. So when it gets to 32 it turns off power to the unit and you can set the differential on the switch to not allow the other switch to come on for 4 or 5 degrees. \n\nMy ACs usually last 5 yrs but some brands are better than others. LG used to be good, i bought some during the supply shortage and those units were really bad. Im using Frigidaire at the moment in two coolers and finding them to be great but I only have two years on them so far. I use them on our farm for vegetable storage so quite a bit of moisture and humidity but they work well and have saved us a down payment on a large house. \n\nThe other thing I'll add, for bigger coolers I have found it better to use two smaller units rather than one big one. The smaller ones are always cheaper, easier to maneuver, and build redundancy into the system so you're not sunk if one goes out. They're so cheap it allows you to buy an extra one to have on hand at the ready as well. \n\nAnyway, great job thanks for sharing.",
