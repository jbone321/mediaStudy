They all underestimated Kratos despite all he\u2019s done that shouldn\u2019t have been or was considered impossible. He defied the sisters of fate, and broke the laws of time itself. Death could not hold him, so what makes the Norse gods so sure they had a chance with a dude that literally killed giants that towered him and made him look like a fruit fly in size comparison",
