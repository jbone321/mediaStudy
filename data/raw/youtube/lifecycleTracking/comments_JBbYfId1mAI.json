It had some issues and honestly better safe than sorry is probably the approach I\u2019d go with as well.\n\nBut you guys didn\u2019t cover uncapped mode? Because in Balanced Mode the Pro pretty much locks to 60, not 40. And even in Quality Mode it can get up into the 50\u2019s. Balanced on Pro is 100 percent the way to go here. Quality settings at 60 fps. If you have a 120hz screen.",

It often feels like they convey half the information with twice the length of a usual DF video. Not sure how others feel, but the frequency of the duo-type videos compared to the usual style has been frustrating to see for me",
