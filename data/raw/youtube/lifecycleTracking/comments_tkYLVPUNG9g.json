The very greatest artists take the world around them, their inner life, their influences and create something thrilling and striking for their age that is of it and also alters it. You could say this of musicians like Louis Armstrong and Bob Dylan, or filmmakers like Orson Welles and Charlie Chaplin and so on. The Iliad and The Odyssey are grand works of art painted with the pigments of all those who came before Homer, whomever he was his sensibilities as an artist define the work...he was looking at what we think of as a time, a place, a history experientially. \nAs Simon reiterated with wonderful constitution the great affect the work we credit to Homer has had on history is not its scientific accuracy to human history, but as a work of art that engaged so many people in so many ways. Homer's works were enjoyed by so many people and all of those people were all out in the world affecting in each of the ways they did for generations. People for ages studied, memorized it and from it built the bedrock of Western canon. How do we explain genius? Why are Jimi Hendrix or Beethoven so great but their relatives or next door neighbors were yet another person who goes about their life unremarkably? It is very romantic, maybe even a bit Homeric to imagine Homer as the great hero of poetry and progenitor of the Western canon alone. If he was one man, or a small set of collaborators, they were flesh and blood like all of us. Alas this being identified as Homer was just tenacious and marvelous enough to give us, somehow, what we now know as The Iliad and The Odyssey. If we cannot give credit flawlessly, let us give thanks generously.",

The idea that Troy was \u201csmall\u201d comes from looking only at the upper citadel, which was just the administrative core. The real city included a much larger fortified lower town, covering around 270,000 m\u00b2 and supporting roughly 5,000-10,000 people, which is right in line with other important cities of the period.  Hattusa itself had about 10,000-12,000 inhabitants, so Troy fits perfectly within the scale of significant Bronze Age urban centers.",

                    "text": "The exchange is stimulating, but I think there is a methodological problem in how the Mycenaean world\u2014and sites such as Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos, or even Troy\u2014are being conceptualized. It is anachronistic to interpret Late Bronze Age palatial centers through categories derived from much later historical formations, such as medieval urbanism, the modern state, or Roman-style fortified cities. The institutional logic of Mycenaean palatial society was different in kind from the Classical polis, and architectural remains should not be forced into later templates of \u201ccity\u201d and \u201cstate.\u201d\n\nThe Mycenaean palaces are better understood as\u00a0palatial-administrative and redistributive centers\u00a0that coordinated production, storage, cult, and elite authority across a surrounding territory. In this respect, they functioned less as \u201ccities\u201d in the later sense and more as\u00a0nodes within a landscape of settlements, with authority expressed through bureaucratic control, elite networks, and ideologically grounded legitimacy. Analogies with other Late Bronze Age systems (including Near Eastern palace-based polities) can be useful insofar as they highlight forms of rule in which administrative centralization and sacral ideology may substitute, at least in part, for the later urban-fortification model.\n\nMoreover, the relationship between multiple palatial centers should not automatically be read as a single \u201cimperial\u201d hierarchy. The evidence is consistent with\u00a0regional kingdoms\u00a0and with a broader\u00a0shared elite culture, patterns of exchange, rivalry, and alliance-making among peer polities, and varying degrees of hierarchy between central places and subordinate communities. In other words, the palatial world can be described as a\u00a0networked political ecology\u00a0rather than a set of autonomous fortified cities.\n\nThis matters for interpreting the Late Bronze Age collapse. The archaeological record shows\u00a0major destructions and burn horizons\u00a0at several palatial centers within a relatively constrained period, but the pattern is not uniform, and trajectories differ by region. Some sites display discontinuity, others show transformation, and some areas appear to retain or reconstitute settlement and social complexity in new forms. The transition to the later city-state landscape should therefore be treated as\u00a0uneven, regionally variable, and temporally staggered, rather than as a single synchronized civilizational \u201cbreak.\u201d\n\nFinally, one should be cautious about inferring political or military capability directly from the scale or defensibility of surviving architectural remains. Monumentality and fortification reflect particular choices within specific institutional contexts; they are not straightforward proxies for mobilization capacity, expeditionary reach, or strategic effectiveness. Historical examples from later periods underline the general point that political-military power can rest on social institutions and mobilization systems rather than on conspicuous urban fabric alone, even if the specific mechanisms differ across epochs.\n\nIn sum, the Mycenaean palaces should be analyzed primarily as components of a\u00a0palatial system\u2014administrative, ideological, and economic\u2014embedded in a wider settlement and territorial framework. Treating them as equivalent to later fortified cities risks conflating fundamentally different political forms and, in turn, misunderstanding both the nature of Mycenaean power and the complexity of its transformation after the Bronze Age.",

Yes, there were other bards before him, many from Anatolia who passed on their tales to later generation. Odysseus's journey to the underworld is bodily lifted from the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh - Utnapishtim, the only mortal granted who was granted immortality by the gods. This is all symbolic - a perilous quest to the edge of the world, usually interpreted as a trip to the land of the dead, i.e. the underworld. Utnapishtim was motivated to take such a perilous journey by his overwhelming grief, and fear too, of death following the passing of his friend Enkidu. Gilgamesh wants to discover the secret of eternal life, hence this trip to the underworld. Odysseus also makes such a journey, meeting dead heroes of the past.",
