I\u2019m currently playing KCD1 and whilst enjoying the game it\u2019s a very slow burn, taking awhile to get things going, the controls feel clunky at times and I hate the lack of customization for the controls. Graphics aren\u2019t awful but they also aren\u2019t great by no means. Combat feels pretty terrible imo although I\u2019m still early in the game at about 4 hours.",
