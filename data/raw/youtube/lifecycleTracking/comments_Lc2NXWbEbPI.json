It's just generating believable human language, but it doesn't actually know anything about the thing you're asking it to review. Either the review will be entirely generic and non-specific (possibly pulling from reviews of earlier entries in the same franchise/genre if those are in its training data) OR you'd have to quickly feed it every other brand new review of the game the second after they are published and then instantly generate a review from the information in all those reviews......which is just straight up plagiarism",

That said, it definitely feels like something that wasn\u2019t made for everyone as some of its systems feel obtuse and archaic at first glance in a way thats similar to other titles that share this genre. While I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it, I understand why other players would rather spend their time and money elsewhere.",
