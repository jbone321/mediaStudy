If I were an actress on that set, I would have had it in my contract that I get the option to keep my wardrobe after all the taping was completed.\nFunny story: I was working as surgical assistant to a female doctor when some Dynasty aired in Nepal. She was a MD, (medical missionary) and I was her go-to person doing many of the pre- and post-surgical reviews on the patients (GYN) as well as first (only) assistant in the OR. So, I go to one family's little home to check on a patient, and they were not there. I was told via hand signs that there were in a small building, so I went there. What did I see? A very small black and white TV with Dynasty playing. This was the village's favorite program, and the ENTIRE village was there. They thought ALL American's lived like that!! Well, I saw my patient. Ask her a few questions to close out her record. I also made sure they knew that I was an American and that what I made in 1 year could not pay for 1 of those outfits.",
