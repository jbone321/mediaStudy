The instruction says burn the doll and she ought to do it that very day her pastor delivered her child but carelessness and nonchalant lifestyle made her let it escape.   This is how most Christians live their life. We neglect things we are not to neglect out of carelessness and nonchalant lifestyle. I pray that the Spirit of God gives us wisdom and increase our prayer altar fire so we can see these things early enough",
