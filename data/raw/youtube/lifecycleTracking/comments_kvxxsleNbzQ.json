More people need to use comms to let each other know wtf they are doing. With BG, at least all his teammates know what his plan is so he can call shots and organize, but often in random lobbies, people just run off without telling you anything and you don't know if they are trying to full clear maps or just blitz the main objective, or if they want to split up or stay together, and when you ask, they either ignore it, or simply kick you for talking. It's infuriating tbh.",
