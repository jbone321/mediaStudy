People were excited, people were ready for the conclusion and anticipating what was coming afterwards.\n\nThis time, the vibes are cautious, worrisome and hopeful that Marvel can complete a comeback and return to what made them THE franchise for a decade. If anything, I would understand if the studio changed their marketing strategy to build the anticipation each and every month beginning with the summer movie season.",

Thanos was strong but doom is 10 times more powerful in him. This movie better have deaths. You can't have a 3 hour movie centered on Dr doom and not have him kill anyone. That would be the biggest disrespect in marvel history. I have a feeling big but not huge characters are gonna die. Like maybe antman, Sam Wilson, one or two of the thunderbolts. Like those kinds of characters will be killed. Maybe Charles Xavier too. But I don't think they'll kill off any of the main avengers or Loki either.",
