                    "text": "That last game was a WILD take of the story of Jonah and the Whale. The story of Jonah in the Old Testament is a tale of disobedience and mercy. God commands the prophet Jonah to warn the wicked city of Nineveh (location at the end), but he flees toward Tarshish (target the player wants to reach) to avoid doing so. After being swallowed by a massive fish (inside the \"iron lung\"), Jonah repents, travels to Nineveh (final scene), and his message causes the city to repent.  What's really interesting to me is that the Old Testament has this place called \"Sheol\".  Sheol is described as both the inside of the giant whale AND the very depths of hell itself.  It's a place that Jonah is sent as punishment for disobedience.  Being in a dark metal iron lung with no windows, no communication, mundane tasks is sort of the modern incarnation of Sheol--the last place a modern person would want to end up in.",
