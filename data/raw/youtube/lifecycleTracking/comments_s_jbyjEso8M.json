They were doing great after 2 seasons but of course they had to try and make an entire Mando-verse! \nStop already was trying to make everything a giant universe! Leave all the characters of that show in that show and maybe spin off one, maybe but that\u2019s it. \n\nThese 500 million dollar need to stop. They need a reset. \nIt looks easily just as good as the TV show did if not better and that\u2019s what we should get. \n\nThe reported budget was 166 million? Awesome! Just get back to basics. If it\u2019s a good movie as in a good story, etc. then it easily looks good enough. The break even point should be around $370 million. Perfect! \n\nAlso, this will BLOW AWAY Supergirl at the box office. Assuming, of course we actually get the real domestic numbers as we still don\u2019t have them from Superman. Funny how that movie bombed impractically every market except the one that James Gunn can get away with lying about? Bullshit!! Black Adam beat it in streaming which proves they\u2019re lying.",
