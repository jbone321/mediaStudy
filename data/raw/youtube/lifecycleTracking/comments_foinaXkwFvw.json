Pushing all the way to the left is recognized as pushing right, so in game your car starts steering left and when you get past 3/4 left it'll suddenly turn all the way to the right which makes it mostly unplayable. Using the stick as you suggested is what I endded up doing, because if you pull the sitck down as you turn left and right it prevents you from pushing all the way to the left and have the game reverse the streering direction brutally. But that's not very comfortable to play.",
