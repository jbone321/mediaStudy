I know some people don\u2019t like the 3D feature but it\u2019s actually pretty dope for a lot of games.\n2) The second screen makes no fucking sense for most emulation. I mean, it doesn\u2019t so\u2026\n3) Legit hardware isn\u2019t that expensive, is endlessly mod-able, and can play generations of games natively\n\nJust buy a New 3DS XL. Yeah, they\u2019ve gone up in price but they\u2019re still cheaper than these stupid Android devices. Also, Android sucks and should be avoided at all cost. If a device doesn\u2019t let you side load Linux, it sucks.",

I know some people don\u2019t like the 3D feature but it\u2019s actually pretty dope for a lot of games.\n2) The second screen makes no fucking sense for most emulation. I mean, it doesn\u2019t so\u2026\n3) Legit hardware isn\u2019t that expensive, is endlessly mod-able, and can play generations of games natively\n\nJust buy a New 3DS XL. Yeah, they\u2019ve gone up in price but they\u2019re still cheaper than these stupid Android devices. Also, Android sucks and should be avoided at all cost. If a device doesn\u2019t let you side load Linux, it sucks.",
