The creators claim they weren't allowed to put the game up to early access when they wanted missing their deadline for players to get a mega bonus for the studio. But the publisher instead claims the game was nowhere close to playable and that the creators that were let go were badgering them when they knew it wasn't ready for release and even consistently skipped going to work a lot. Honestly it's hard to tell who's taking advantage of who as both have something to gain from this.",

The creators claim they weren't allowed to put the game up to early access when they wanted missing their deadline for players to get a mega bonus for the studio.

Honestly it's hard to tell who's taking advantage of who as both have something to gain from this.",
