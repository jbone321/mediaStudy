On a different live I heard you say it will automatically become retirement. Its increased with cola $1730.. waiting for the decision they gave me SSI and that got me Medicaid. \n\nSSI Stopped once SSDI Started and Medicaid stopped at 2 years became Medicare. The amount is what I've been providing for my family of 4. I learned last year that my school aged son can draw from my SSDI so I applied and they allotted him just over $800, a tremendous help! My wife is being deported not able to return for 10 years if granted . There's nothing on her side for SS benefits. My sons will end at 18 I think. They reduced the SNAP to $24 I assume because of what my son gets now. Should I be worried?",
