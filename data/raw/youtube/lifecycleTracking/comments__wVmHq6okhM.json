I am computer inept so I\u2019m not sure how well I will do with the AI but will see. I do like have actually paper information in my gardening binder. I do use my phone calendar and alarms for reminders in everything from gardening to medical appts etc. Really learn a lot from your channel.  Thank you !\ud83c\udf3a",
