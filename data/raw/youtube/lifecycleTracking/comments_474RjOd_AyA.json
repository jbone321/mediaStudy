The first one is the one I swipe for literally everything \u2014 and right now you can earn 125,000 points through this link which is basically a free luxury flight if you use it right.\n\nThis is how I started flying business class without paying business class prices. \ud83e\udd0d\n\nLet me know if you have questions \u2014 you deserve to travel bougie too!!\n\nhttps://oc.brcclx.com/t?lid=26757984",
