I love chili and I make it often. It's so good, so cheap and so easy to make. \n\nF1nn, now that you're learning how to cook, you should tackle a dish known as Pate Chinois or French-Canadian cottage pie. It's like English cottage pie with fewer spices and fewer vegetables. The only vegetables are a 15-oz can of drained whole kernel corn, a 15-oz can of cream-style corn and a medium yellow onion that's been diced and fried until it's translucent. And the only spices are salt and pepper. The spices are minimal, but the dish is SO good.",

Share some, freeze some (chili freezes really nicely!), leave some mild and add habanero pepper to some, have fun with it! I may make some chili this weekend, now that I'm thinking about it. It's a simple recipe, and I do mine in a crock pot, so it's extra simple.",
