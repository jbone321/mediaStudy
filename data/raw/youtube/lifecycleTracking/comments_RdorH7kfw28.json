I purchased Dimension 2EW liquid and the application rate is .38 to .73 fluid ounces per acre.  I would think a light application would be anything under 1/2 the maximum rate, but what is Doc 's light rate that makes it effective for a southern Bermuda lawn?  It's pricey so I don't want to waste it which would happen either too light (not effective) or too heavy, (wasting product).",
