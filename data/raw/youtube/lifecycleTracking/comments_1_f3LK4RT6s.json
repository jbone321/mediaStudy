I've never expected it end up as a whole game. So, it served its goal, I believe, and we'll see many of those in your future games. The videos were fun, interesting, educational for me. Thanks a lot and hope to see your next game soon!",

It could be like hitman but more freeing. For example you play as a thing that will destroy an evil company or something. You sneak to kill the leader because if you go in guns blazing he will evacuate, then you shoot up the rest to clear the level, or keep sneaking. I feel like the mechanics can be salvaged, but I completely understand why you would stop.",
