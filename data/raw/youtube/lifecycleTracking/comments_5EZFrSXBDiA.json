Halo, Half-Life 2, Deus Ex and especially Unreal. Imagine Facing Worlds map in VR with the music we all love. I'm so crazy about Unreal games I created a documentary on my channel for every game for 25th Anniversary of Unreal Tournament. Over 350 maps, 1TB of footage to edit, 1 year in the making but who can stop us when we love something? :)",

Firewall was the first game in VR that I really dove into and we had a squad that plated together for months.",

Sony does seem to support the device but quietly in the background via throwing money at big external devs about once a year - they pushed hard to secure PSVR2 support for Microsoft flight simulator which should be coming this year.",
