I was so surprised by that, since he took the time to pause his phone conversation, though I responded right back at him with a smile and it actually made my day, almost bringing a tear to my eye. All at once it hit me that I'm getting older, made me feel good for being seen but also really proud of him and his parents for raising such a polite young man. I thought if my kids turn out that way one day I'd be pretty happy myself. \ud83d\udcaf",

When you make a situation personalized towards the other person, they automatically feel better about themselves and will just naturally treat you with more attentiveness and respect. So just remember to always be polite and respect others and take the time to get to know someone's name. You never know what kind of a difference that could make in some person's day. They could be having the shittiest day of their life and just to know that somebody recognized them by their name and was happy to see them that day could mean the world to them.",
