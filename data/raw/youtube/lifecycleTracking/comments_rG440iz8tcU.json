So Im happy the album is coming next week. \nI think \u201ecasino\u201c is not the best name because of Drakes Stake deal. Now whenever they shoot against Drake because of the Stake deal there is this casino \u201ething\u201c which is also \u201equestionable\u201c. \nI personally am fine with the casino album and the Stake deal.",
