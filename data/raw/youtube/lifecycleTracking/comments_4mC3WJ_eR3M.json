Inviting a competitive exam tutor to fix education is precisely why the system remains an intellectual wasteland. Abhinay Maths does not teach the unyielding, axiomatic discipline of pure mathematics; he teaches cheap algorithmic shortcuts and rote-memorization tricks so desperate students can pass multiple-choice exams for government desk jobs. He is a symptom of the exact transactional 'brain rot' you claim to be fighting.\n\nIf you wanted to discuss how to forge actual, world-class intellects, you should have called a foundational logician or a strict pure mathematician someone like Dr. Paolo Aluffi, or a Fields Medalist like Manjul Bhargava. You sit there complaining that schools don't teach trivial vocational skills like the 'stock market' or 'management.' That is absolute nonsense. If you subjected a student's mind to uncompromising, hardcore mathematical logic, they could teach themselves the rules of the stock market in a weekend. Instead, you are watering down the definition of education to mean 'corporate job training.' Stop validating this mediocrity and start demanding actual academic discipline.",
