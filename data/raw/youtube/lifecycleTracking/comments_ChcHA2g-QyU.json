He ages insanely slow so unless there\u2019s ever a huge time jump there won\u2019t be a huge difference in how he acts. I understand getting tired of the baby thing but he\u2019s a baby so he acts like one if he was a teenager but acted like a baby I\u2019d understand more",

When The Mandalorian was released, it was considered an achievement as a movie-level TV show in Star Wars. I don't understand how you can say this doesn't look cinematic enough for the big screen but then go and say the Ant-Man movies are great for Marvel because they are small heist movies. A movie's scale and budget should match the premise. This is not a Skywalker saga event film; this is a fun adventure film in the criminal underworld. It does not need a huge budget. It looks like a movie for theaters as much as any blockbuster.",
