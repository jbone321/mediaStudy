My wife and I set up ours this way.  When she unexpectedly died at 70 our two sons received 80% of her Traditional and Roth IRA's.  They have 10 years to manage the distributions from their inherited IRA, $400k+ each.  If I survive at least 10 more years they will have another separate 10 year period to manage distributions from the IRA's they will inherit from me.  As the survivor, I have more time to continue making Roth conversions to lessen their eventual tax burden later.",
