People know you\u2019re not truly washing any of those boxes and containers prior to putting them inside your crockpot or baking dish. It\u2019s a shame because many of the recipes might be worth trying, but watching you cook makes a person vomit because of how unsanitary you work. From some of the comments it appears you have imposter followers who conveniently write positive comments for you, it\u2019s obvious those are fake comments. For longevity you should focus on quality rather than short term sensationalism.",
