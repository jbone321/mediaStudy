When I heard that some people were upset that he was performing all in Spanish I had to check it out for myself to see what the hype was about.  I loved it so much I replayed it five more times  and put his music on my phone. When lady ga ga came on I felt emotional. Needless to say I'm  becoming a fan and I never thought I would. I don't understand anything he's saying, but I can't get enough of the positive colorful  vibes and the beats. This was one  of the best halftimes I think I've ever seen.",
