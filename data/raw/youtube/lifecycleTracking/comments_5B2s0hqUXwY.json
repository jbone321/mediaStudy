If it was accurate, it should correlate with the moonsighters; imagine a stress test that was 50% accurate and 50% inaccurate at predicting CAD, or some lab test that had terrible sensitivity and specificity of a coin toss. Would we ever use that? Yet these clowns act as if they are so sophisticated, when in fact that they are the ignoramuses from a scientific standpoint. They can come up with a mathematical model based on criteria that gives 95+% accuracy for scheduling purposes which they can then confirm with visual moonsighting as the clincher, but they refuse based on pure hatred of tradition and arrogance, I suspect.",

This was an intentional and deliberate move by Yasir Kazi and the FCNA to force this upon the western Muslims (he boasts in one video that soon moonsighting masajid will disappear). But these idiots are so unscientific that they don't realize that by using an elongation of >8 degrees and the moon > 5 degrees above the horizon as their criteria as opposed to conjunction, they have accepted moonsighting as the gold standard. And why shouldn't it be? Visual confirmation trumps any mathematic model that attempts at to predict the visual reality, and which can by definition be only at best as good as the gold standard. As a cardiac surgeon, it's like someone saying that they will take a stress test which indirectly checks for coronary artery disease, over a cath where one can visualize the blockage. Smh, these fools are so enamored with science, they don't even know foundational epistemology and statistics.",
