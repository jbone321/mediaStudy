Here's a follow up to my last soil blocking video which you can watch here if you haven't already- https://youtu.be/ByLv8lVglj8\n\nThis new one covers what can go wrong when making soil blocks and I also demonstrate how to make them using a smaller, more affordable soil blocker if you're sowing seeds on a smaller scale than I am.",
