A tanks really just be paying attention to the front and IF they turn about they will see what happens in the backline. Dps usually pay attention to their on stuff busy flanking diving ect... but the support pays attention to the whole game and whole team. The ults, when to ults, who is about to go down, who is out of position who is struggling, who is doing well they usually know why the team is losing and how to fix it. If a support tells you swtich, switch if a support tells you 2 tanks go 2 tanks, if need peels, peel. People think the support role is meaningless  and cheer on kills and damage. But the support is the most important role. The whole game goes around the support. In high elo its all about what supports your using and their ult that determines who wins the game.",
