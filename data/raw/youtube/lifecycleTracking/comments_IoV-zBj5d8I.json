I just want to say first of all, thank you very much for all your videos and that you help everyone, but there are too many videos on how to enter a lucid dream. If you could just make just one video on a training system or something like that that will actually make you enter a lucid dream without being too confusing, just make a simple guide on how to enter a lucid dream.",

I just want to say first of all, thank you very much for all your videos and that you help everyone, but there are too many videos on how to enter a lucid dream. If you could just make just one video on a training system or something like that that will actually make you enter a lucid dream without being too confusing, just make a simple guide on how to enter a lucid dream.",
