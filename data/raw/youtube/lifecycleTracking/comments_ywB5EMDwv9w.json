I bought a bakerboy hat this year and I really like it , looks quite stylish but isn't particularly a glamorous hat but I do feel like a bratz doll wearing it with my flared jeans and corset style puffer jacket. Most of my clothes are grey because it's always been my favourite colour which can come across quite ethereal at times depending on what fabrics I choose to wear and it's hard to wear any other colour in the winter because I have to make sure the colour works with a few outfits to my personal taste, including coats. I would love to start wearing more deep red (although very difficult  to find) because it's one of my best colours as a deep autumn with high romantic essence but maybe I will add more things in summer and next autumn/winter. I can't wear jewellery in winter because earrings wouldn't be seeable and would be uncomfortable with hair, hats and scarfs, necklaces would be freezing , rings would be uncomfortable and difficult when wearing gloves. I used to love a bit of animal print but I can't stand it now , I used to be very sun and everything's changed in my 30s so I feel a little lost in my style at the moment. I think when you hit your 30s you go through a lot of changes because your brain has become fully developed and you know yourself better, you realise things and you want to be more settled and secure in life and within yourself.",

I bought a bakerboy hat this year and I really like it , looks quite stylish but isn't particularly a glamorous hat but I do feel like a bratz doll wearing it with my flared jeans and corset style puffer jacket. Most of my clothes are grey because it's always been my favourite colour which can come across quite ethereal at times depending on what fabrics I choose to wear and it's hard to wear any other colour in the winter because I have to make sure the colour works with a few outfits to my personal taste, including coats. I would love to start wearing more deep red (although very difficult  to find) because it's one of my best colours as a deep autumn with high romantic essence but maybe I will add more things in summer and next autumn/winter. I can't wear jewellery in winter because earrings wouldn't be seeable and would be uncomfortable with hair, hats and scarfs, necklaces would be freezing , rings would be uncomfortable and difficult when wearing gloves. I used to love a bit of animal print but I can't stand it now , I used to be very sun and everything's changed in my 30s so I feel a little lost in my style at the moment. I think when you hit your 30s you go through a lot of changes because your brain has become fully developed and you know yourself better, you realise things and you want to be more settled and secure in life and within yourself.",

I bought a bakerboy hat this year and I really like it , looks quite stylish but isn't particularly a glamorous hat but I do feel like a bratz doll wearing it with my flared jeans and corset style puffer jacket. Most of my clothes are grey because it's always been my favourite colour which can come across quite ethereal at times depending on what fabrics I choose to wear and it's hard to wear any other colour in the winter because I have to make sure the colour works with a few outfits to my personal taste, including coats. I would love to start wearing more deep red (although very difficult  to find) because it's one of my best colours as a deep autumn with high romantic essence but maybe I will add more things in summer and next autumn/winter. I can't wear jewellery in winter because earrings wouldn't be seeable and would be uncomfortable with hair, hats and scarfs, necklaces would be freezing , rings would be uncomfortable and difficult when wearing gloves. I used to love a bit of animal print but I can't stand it now , I used to be very sun and everything's changed in my 30s so I feel a little lost in my style at the moment. I think when you hit your 30s you go through a lot of changes because your brain has become fully developed and you know yourself better, you realise things and you want to be more settled and secure in life and within yourself.",

More casual (as well as formal) clothing brands should think about UPF, bc people should be protect when they\u2019re going to class, work or run their errands (and still want to not be stuck to sporty pieces)!",

Some elements that translate as sensual/bold don't really register as such to me, because they simply feel natural.",
