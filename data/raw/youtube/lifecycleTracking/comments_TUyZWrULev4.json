And of course, in Japanese it makes sense that she speaks English given how dominant English was in the corporate sphere back when the game first got released. But of course you can't get her to speak English in a fully English game because the message gets lost. So what would it be the option here? French. Doesn't help that she's an expert fencer.\nAt most, in the remake they could have made her speak Mandarin Chinese given how China is now the leading economic superpower.",

And of course, in Japanese it makes sense that she speaks English given how dominant English was in the corporate sphere back when the game first got released. But of course you can't get her to speak English in a fully English game because the message gets lost. So what would it be the option here? French. Doesn't help that she's an expert fencer.\nAt most, in the remake they could have made her speak Mandarin Chinese given how China is now the leading economic superpower.",
