I know you are testing a lot these days. However, please slow down, BE PATIENT, listen to your live audience trying to better understand what they are saying plus ask better questions of them, as well as address the issues as they arise. You are a great content creator, do great work, and yes, want to improve your setup. Just don't let it get in the way of EVERY stream. Since the new year began and you have stopped using your phone to stream full-time, there has been a larger issue, more than a regular stream glitch. You ask for our feedback. As a channel supporter, I share mine with you. Stay safe and healthy.",
