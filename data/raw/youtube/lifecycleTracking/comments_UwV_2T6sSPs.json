The whole using gestures to get two apps side-by-side didn\u2019t really work and that\u2019s why you added the three dots at the top of an app so you can enter half-and-half so much easier. Not only that, but you didn\u2019t have to only choose from your apps in the dock as your second app, you could side-by-side any two apps easily. Now we\u2019re back to gestures which I like but for a lot of users, both young and old, is not easy. There is best practice. It seems like you\u2019re just trying to make a new operating system each year to sell iPads and you change things\u2014but isn\u2019t there a best way to do something? After years and years of iPadOS?",

I also can\u2019t drag windows out anymore. I could waive an app out of the way previously, but now I need to tap the windows control button to have options, then try to tap minimize. This is not an expected behavior for a touch screen. I should not tap a button twice just to minimize or close an app. I need to be able to slide it, as Windows 8 mastered more than a decade ago. And of course, the keyboard has insane borders issue, even worse than on the iPhone, which is already a huge topic on social media on its own. Horrible update, who asked for this?
