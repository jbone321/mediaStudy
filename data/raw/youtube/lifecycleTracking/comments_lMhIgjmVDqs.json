Ever. It\u2019s a constant loop and cycle of thoughts and even when you get that reassurance, it\u2019s STILL not enough. I think the only way to \u201cbeat\u201d it is to accept it, to make friends with it in a way, to say ok fine whatever even if this kills me I\u2019m still gonna live my life and you wont fking stop me .",
