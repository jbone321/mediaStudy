My induction hob has dials that click, so I know which numbers they're on, and the rings are marked with silicon things called pan-pickles. The microwave has things called bump-ons (rubber stickers) which I ask a sighted person to put over the buttons. For me, I prefer to use equipment that isn't specialised, but that has adaptions that I or the sighted people in my life can do quickly and cheaply. Not saying one way is better, but I find that sometimes people assume blind people can't use equipment unless it talks, so thought I'd clarify. :)",

The microwave has things called bump-ons (rubber stickers) which I ask a sighted person to put over the buttons. For me, I prefer to use equipment that isn't specialised, but that has adaptions that I or the sighted people in my life can do quickly and cheaply. Not saying one way is better, but I find that sometimes people assume blind people can't use equipment unless it talks, so thought I'd clarify. :)",
