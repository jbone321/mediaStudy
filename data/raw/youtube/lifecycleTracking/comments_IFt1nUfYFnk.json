I'm designing for a household with several sleep disorders and at least one night shift worker, and I need to be able to program the light hue to support people waking up comfortably in the morning, being fully awake, alert, and productive in the middle of the day, and being able to calm down and go to sleep at a sensible time at night - including the night shift suite being programmed on a different time zone to the rest of the house. Also I absolutely will not have our household lighting or any other household management systems connected to the internet or depending on an app to work. We need wired-in controls and a household systems computer that is not connected to the internet.\n\nThe almighty al-thingy hasn't offered me any updates on this technology in a while, and I'd really like to know what the latest offerings are from the various manufacturers in this space.",

The accent and decorative lights are where I have the most fun. My favorites these days are spotlights with goboes (a patterned stencil on the light source that creates interesting shadows) on a plant-filled corner to create a sense of movement and forest shadows, and small, low-wattage stained glass table lamps to serve as a way-finding light in a darkened room or hallway. The patterned shadows and dappled color washes add depth and texture in the evening hours.\n\nYou may want to expand your light curriculum to include the versatility that certain technical components offer:  dimmer switches, \"smart\" fixtures, motion and dawn-to-dusk sensing fixtures. And if you're into landscape lighting, the world opens to include solar fixtures. I've been having a lot of fun in this category, as well, experimenting with renter-friendly ways to light a deck and shadowy exterior walkways/staircases instead of relying on harsh, high-powered floodlights.",

I would love a small section dedicated to candles, as I love them and I feel they add depth to the lighting while also being decorative, but I'm always a bit lost as to when to light them or where to put them... And I feel like it's not enough talked about",

People said it was supposed to help me by \u201clooking at it,\u201d so while it was sitting on the desk by our computer I would be staring right at it. \ud83d\ude05 I do not reccomend looking right at it.

The accent and decorative lights are where I have the most fun. My favorites these days are spotlights with goboes (a patterned stencil on the light source that creates interesting shadows) on a plant-filled corner to create a sense of movement and forest shadows, and small, low-wattage stained glass table lamps to serve as a way-finding light in a darkened room or hallway. The patterned shadows and dappled color washes add depth and texture in the evening hours.\n\nYou may want to expand your light curriculum to include the versatility that certain technical components offer:  dimmer switches, \"smart\" fixtures, motion and dawn-to-dusk sensing fixtures. And if you're into landscape lighting, the world opens to include solar fixtures. I've been having a lot of fun in this category, as well, experimenting with renter-friendly ways to light a deck and shadowy exterior walkways/staircases instead of relying on harsh, high-powered floodlights.",

Also I absolutely will not have our household lighting or any other household management systems connected to the internet or depending on an app to work. We need wired-in controls and a household systems computer that is not connected to the internet.\n\nThe almighty al-thingy hasn't offered me any updates on this technology in a while, and I'd really like to know what the latest offerings are from the various manufacturers in this space.",
