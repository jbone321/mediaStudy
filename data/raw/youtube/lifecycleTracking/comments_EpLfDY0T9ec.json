I can't agree. Code Vein II had great character customization. The exploration was rewarding with cool stuff tucked away in all sorts of nooks and crannies. The combat was solid. The characters were memorable. The storytelling was at times beautiful and emotional. The bosses were challenging. Nothing about Code Vein II felt \"mediocre.\"\n\nYeah, the bike could use some adjustments. Some bosses definitely need rebalancing. And there are mechanics and terms that could use better explanation. But still, I thought it was a darn fine game. Much better than other Soulslike titles such as Steel Rising or The Surge.",
